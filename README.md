# Decimal to Binary, Binary to Decimal, etc.

This was just a project that I completed for school, specifically CSCI 321 Assembly Language @ FHSU.

Has a simple UI and prompts the user to select from a menu the following:
1) Binary to decimal (ex. 101101 = 45)
2) Decimal to binary (ex. 45 = 101101)
3) Add two binaries (10101010 + 11001100 = 0101110110)
4) Grading feature (tests functions for errors)
5) QUIT
